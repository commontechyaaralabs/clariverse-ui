The audit revealed that the supporting documentation for the initial ‘Know Your Customer’ verification is incomplete. Specifically, a copy of Mr. Dubois’s passport, as per Article 13 of the GDPR and the requirements of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (4AMLD), is missing from the digital file. \n\nThe auditor flagged this as a medium-risk finding, potentially exposing us to regulatory scrutiny from the ECB and the French financial authorities (AMF).  The account is currently active with a balance of €12,500. \n\nCould you please investigate this matter urgently and provide an update on the steps being taken to rectify the missing documentation?  I would appreciate a confirmation of receipt and an estimated timeframe for resolution.  Please also document the investigation process and any communication with Mr. Dubois in the compliance management system.  We need to ensure full adherence to our internal policies and external regulatory requirements. \n\nBest regards,\n\nVictoria Alvarez\nCompliance Officer\nEurobank S.A.\nParis Branch"

The transfer reference is BXF-20250415-007, for a total amount of EUR 25,000.00.\n\nOur records indicate the transfer was successfully dispatched via the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) network. However, the beneficiary has reported a discrepancy in the received amount. They confirm only EUR 24,750.00 was credited to their account. \n\nWe have reviewed our internal systems and confirmed the full EUR 25,000.00 was debited from the originating account and sent via the SWIFT network. We suspect a potential issue with the FX settlement or intermediary bank charges, despite the transfer being denominated in EUR. \n\nCould you please investigate this discrepancy and provide a detailed breakdown of the funds flow, including any associated fees or exchange rate applied during the settlement process?  We are operating under PSD2 regulations and require a clear audit trail to resolve this matter for our client.  Please also confirm the exact time of receipt of the funds into your system.\n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this issue.\n\nMit freundlichen Grüßen,\n\nJames Davidson\nSenior International Payments Officer\nDeutsche Finanzbank AG\nFrankfurt, Germany\nTel: +49 69 12345678\nEmail: jamesdavidson5023@gmail.com"

Specifically, we are interested in understanding the factors contributing to the lower DSCR and the mitigating actions your company is taking to restore compliance.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, this breach triggers a notification requirement and a review period.

          "plain": "Dear Joshua,\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nFollowing the recent regulatory updates regarding the revised Cross-Border Payments Directive (CBPD) and its implications for our SEPA transfers, the Project Nightingale team has completed the implementation of the necessary system upgrades and procedural changes. These updates ensure full compliance with the new requirements, specifically regarding enhanced customer due diligence for cross-border transactions exceeding €10,000 and the revised reporting standards to the relevant National Competent Authorities.\n\nWe have conducted thorough testing, including simulations of various transaction scenarios and data validation checks, and the results confirm that the system is functioning as expected. However, before we officially roll out these changes to all customers, we require your final approval to proceed. The implementation impacts approximately 3,500 corporate clients and necessitates a communication campaign outlining the updated terms and conditions.\n\nThe detailed implementation report, including the risk assessment and mitigation strategies, is attached for your review.  We anticipate a minimal disruption to customer transactions during the rollout, but proactive communication is crucial.  The estimated cost of the rollout, including communication and potential minor system adjustments, is €18,500.  This falls within the approved budget for regulatory compliance initiatives.\n\nPlease advise at your earliest convenience whether you approve the rollout.  We are prepared to begin the communication campaign immediately upon receiving your confirmation.\n\nBest regards,\n\nEthan Sutton\nSenior Compliance Officer\nEurobank AG\nFrankfurt"

We have contacted Deutsche Bank Frankfurt to confirm the documents received, and they confirm the discrepancy exists.  We understand the exporter, 'Boulangerie Artisanale', may have inadvertently entered the incorrect amount.  \n\nCould you please advise if you wish us to negotiate the documents despite the discrepancy, seek a waiver from the applicant, or return the documents to the collecting bank?  We have placed a hold on the funds pending your instructions to avoid any potential payment delays.
